## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

what process i have done in this projects:

-   taken the scratch project from udasity links which are provided.
-   all the papers are taken in the 'app.js'.
-   used  dependences font-awesome and font- family in 'app.css'.
-   used a code to open the papers  by using the event Listener.
-   used timer when game starts.
-   Based on number of moves star rating is given in code.
-   when all papers are matched then a window is opened to congrates the player.
-   after to restart the game the papers are shuffled.
-   A sweet alert box is uesd to display our performance.
